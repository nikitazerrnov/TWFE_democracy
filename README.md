Code &amp; Report for the Project "Prosperity and Democracy: Examining the Correlation through Two-Way Fixed-Effects Modelling"

The following repository contains the code (and the required files) and the report for the Master's project. 

The causal link between democracy and economic development has been established half a century ago by @lipset1959, however, 
it remains the subject of still ongoing debate among scholars. While modernisation theory suggests that economic growth leads to 
increased demand for democracy, there are exceptions to this rule, such as China's experience. This paper tests the hypothesis of 
modernisation theory using Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) data from 1991 to 2019 with a help of a Two-Way Fixed-Effects OLS regression model.
We find a statistically significant positive relationship between GDP per capita and the Polyarchy index of democracy. 
However, the relationship is relatively weak, and the issue of the direction of causality remains open for future research. 
The study fills an important gap in the literature by providing a more contemporary analysis of the relationship between wealth and democracy.
